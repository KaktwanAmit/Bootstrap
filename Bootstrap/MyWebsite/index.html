                            <p>Oil Rush is a tower defense real-time strategy game developed by Unigine Corp using their Unigine engine technology. Set in a flooded, post-apocalyptic world, the game consists of players fighting over control of the world's last remaining oil reserves. The game was released as a digital download for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X.</p>
                            <p>
                                This theme has been viewed as controversial by some, especially as Oil Rush was originally intended to be released only a little more than a year after the much publicized Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The game itself actually delivers an environmental warning message, with Unigine's CEO Denis Shergin commenting that Fuel devouring armies that fight over the last drops of oil and pollute already trashed world is nothing but doublethink. That is a warning environmental message we'd like to deliver in a single-player campaign.</p>

                            <p>Devil May Cry is a video game series developed by Capcom and created by Hideki Kamiya. Originally intended to be a sequel in Capcom's Resident Evil series, in development it became such a radical departure from the series' style that it was developed into a new property entirely. The series centers on the main character Dante's goal of avenging his mother's murder by exterminating demons. The gameplay consists of heavy combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of attacks while avoiding damage in order to exhibit stylized combat; this element along with time and the amount of items collected and used are taken under consideration when grading the player's performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The series is very loosely based on the Italian poem Divine Comedy by the use of allusions, including the game's protagonist Dante and other characters like Vergil, Trish, Lucia, Trismagia, Furiataurus, Geryon, and Cerberus. Many of the enemies are also named after the Seven Deadly Sins, such as "Hell Pride" or "Hell Lust".</p>
